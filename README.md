Saitek Cyborg 3d USB arduino code

For converting my Cyborg 3d Joystick to USB2 using Leonardo Pro Micro board. (Original joystick circuitry was USB1. which worked fine in a PC, but the Xbox Adaptive controller wouldn't recognise it). Complete rewire inside to make it work!

For use with Xbox Adaptive Controller
